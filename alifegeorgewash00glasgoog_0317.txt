hired as not Athenian, by the orer-strictuess of their Attic

Greek, by the stiff precision, the ornate redundancy, aud

' the servile imitationes ancient models. Not content

with being well acquainted with the language, the com-
posers uf scholastic Latin have for the most part applied ·
themselves to copy werd fur word, and sentence fur sen-
tence, the style of this er that Roman author. Every
phrase was modelled upon the shape of the phrase oe-
cupying a similar position in the work of Livy or Tacitus,
Sallust or Cicero; so that the entire work has been
rather a cento of some old author, a thing of shreds and
patches, than an original composition.

Widely different from thie is the Life of Washington‚

.- by Francis Giass-he has written with a full mind, with

whatever they learn therefrom will be as just end pure

head. This it is which gives us hope, that, written as it
is in the universal tongue, the one language current among
the scientific and the polished from Buenos Ayres te Ice-
land, from the islands of the Pacific to the shores of the
Atlantic‚ it may become a text-book and a standing history
in other hemispheres-that it may be studied by mysti-

Merico or Paraguay; that it may inspire the hyperborean
Russ with the ardent love of liberty, and teach to the
volatile Gaul stability and firmness, by the noble example
of the most equable and constant-minded meu, the firm·
