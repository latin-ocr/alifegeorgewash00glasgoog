of what genius and labour, unaided and unencouraged,

esu accomplish, is truly a saepo tteoeaa. But this work is
not merely interesting as a curiosity. lt is written with
surprising accuracy, aud really possessos no common
portion of the ease, spirit, aud reciness of classicalcom-
position. Mr. Reynolds deserves well of his country for
his attempt to introduce it into our schools as a book of
elementary instruction. It is not only quite equal, in
point of Latinity, to many of the works of modern schol·
ars which are already in use for that purpose, hut its sub·
jeet will give it a fer higher interest for American youth,
while it serves to keep before their minds the example of
that ‘⁴ august and immortal man,” the spirit of whose his-
tory will do scarcely less to preserve the liberties of his
country, than the wisdom of the institutione which he has

bequeathed her.

lcannot conclude this notice without alluding to the ·

affectionate and eloquent tribute which Mr. Reynolds has
paid to the memory of his friend and instructer‚ in the
introductory memoir‚ and which, from its tendency to
cherish a generous love of classical studies, contributes

not a little, in my opinion, to the charin and velue of the

work. J. PROUDFIT

Dran Sira-I heve examined Mr. Glaes's Life of Wash-
lngton iu Latin, and have formed a very favourable opin-
ion of its general merits. 'lhough the work has some
defecta, yet these are trifling when compared with its

excellencesy and many parts displaya purity of style, ’

sufficient to rank the author very high in the scale of
modern Latin writers. lt will be perused with interest
and utility by the youthful mind, and deserves to find a
plaee ln the library of the classical scholar.
