rerumne-1 have been slow in expressing an
· opinion of your Glats's Liseos Woshington, not from in·
difference to its merite, but because l have thought it
deserving of a more careful and critical reading thanl
at first intended to give it. Itis not only a literary corios·
ity. but in truth a work of rare merit. We have been so
little accustomed to look for worlrs of this kind among
ourselves, and so much in the habitos depending upon
the Germane for our preliminary Latin books, that even
our national vanity does not prevent us frorn the exercise
of exemplary cantion and scrutiny before we seriously
tallr of introducing American Latin into our schools. Ι
herard the opinion, however, that, wlule we all agree that
the finish and ripeness of classical scholarship cau only
be attained by a patient and long-continued study of the
classic moden, Gloss'sLiseos Wesltington will be found, ·
even in point of Latinity, to deservo a place in the pre·
¹scribcd course of studies preparatory to our collegas,

⁴ and I shall rejoice to see it holding the position which it

merite in our best Latin schools and academias through·
out the country.
I romain, sir, with sincere respect,
Your friend and servant,
