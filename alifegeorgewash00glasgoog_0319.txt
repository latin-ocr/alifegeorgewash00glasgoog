F'rom tlte Nero-Yorker.

Ic is with no small satisfaction we announce te our
readers the appearance of this work; because it cannot
fail to produce the happiest effecta upon the rising gener·
ation, when introduced into our schools as aciens-book,
which it undoubtedly will be. A life of Washington in
Latin is indeed peculiarly appropriate un many accounts.
Whose deeds more worthy of ita lofty dictioni Whose
virtues more deserving of its majesticsimplicityl What
Roman could boast of alife so pure l-of patriotism so ·
disinferestcdl It is well to piace in the hands of our
youth this ‘record of the Father of his country, in the
same lauguage in which they read of the valour of Cesar,

*¹ of the prudence of Fabius, and the virtues of Cincinna-

tus; for it will enable them, with a glow of honest pride, ’
to feel that in Washington all these rare and exalted at·
tributes were combined. Nor will it be less gratifyirrg
to them to knoW, that in the wilds of Ohioa ‘⁴ Gfoar” hae
. been found to hold up to the world an imperishable image
of him who hae been emphaticaily and truly pronounced
to be the ‘⁴ first in war, first in peace, and firstin the hearts
of his countrymen.”

Of its Latinity and style it would ill become usto speak,
since sufficient proof accompanics the work, in the certifi-
cetes annexed to it, of many of our professore, who bear
ample testimony to its purity, ite beauty, and ita force.

From tlte Nero-York Times.

Teis, if it be not the best, is the most extraordinary
book of the day. Asa specimen of pure Latinity, ithae
’ been pronounced by the best scholare in the country to
be a singularly correct and beautiful production. It
¹ comes before the public in a manner which should corn-
mend it to its kindest attention3 and if, as we have every
reason to believe, it ,is a specimen cf Latinity as pure as
it is uncornmon, there can be no doubt that it will bo gen·
erally adopted by our schools and seminariae of learning.
We shall again allude to this extraordinary productioe3
and in the meantime we commend it to the attention of
the scholare of eur couptry.
