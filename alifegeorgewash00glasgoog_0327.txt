admirable. Ha has not given us a narrative in Intinized
- English, but his beck throughout savours oi an original
Roman idiom. -

,lsuch an untbrteking rs much more difficolt than the
waiting askarih esaces and annotatione to classic au·
thore, or οιοῷιίοιιί sketches ο1 ιιοιι who lived in >a

That the author* ts sometimes obscure, and rs occa
atonally led ιο adopt a harsh or salsa idiom,1s not a matter
oi surprise when we consider the difficulty ο1 adapting an
. obsoleta language to novel events and operatione N ei
t huhr, the historiari confessed, late ιιι his hle that although
jditthad from childhood written Latin,‘ ‘it was only within
asew y ears that be had been able ιο call the language his
‚ own” 0f our author's style no more can be said by way
⁵ of criticism than was said of the illustrioris Hemsterhuys,

“Una orationi facilitas de est, non comparanda illa, nisi

aaepe multumque scribendo.’' But in the style of the

author, there is osten a felicity ο1 expression, a union ο1
brevity, accuracy‚ and clearness which must surprise
every classical reader. In some passages there is a de·
gree of eloquence and sustained vigour, not unworthy the
pen ο1 Ceasar himself. lf, throughout the work, there
are occasional transgressions of that tame correctness
which characterizes the continental school-book Latin, it
ia not, like them, in any part, a mere accommodatiori and
transcript ο1 ancient formulas of speech and set phrases..

Itis evidently the productos a mind thoroughly imbued

with the principles and genius ofthe Roman tangue, and

capable of forming new combinatione ιο suit new circum·

stances, in strict accordance with the analogias of tha

Latin language.

· ' I think it is well suited, iu every respect, to the pur-

tlte teacher be competent ιο turn even passages ο1 quea·
tionable Latinity to good account by verbal criticisms. 1
have strongly recommended it sor that purpose in this vi·
cinity, and hope it will coma into general use. Itis a
great recommendation ο1 the book in this particular, that
it is so well printed. ll Ι had never studied worse type
