hulleto, is something better, we imagine, than Wytten-
bach’s bombardae, sor a cannon3 Milton's globulus, sor a
buttou3 or Grotius’ engilrammum, sor a wig. As a spe-
cimen of Mr. G.’s Latinity, we subjoiu an extract from
the work. It is Judge Marshall's announcement in Con·
grass of the death of Washiugtou.

The “ barbarisms” of Mr. Glass are always so well iu
accordante with the genius of Latin declension, as never
to appear at variance with the spirit of the language, or
out of placeio their respective situations. His “equiv-
alents,’' too, are, in eil cases, ingeniously managed: and
we are mistaken if the same ean be said of the “ equiv-
alents” of Erasmus—certainly not of those used by Gro-
tius, or Addison, or Sciuoeckh, or Buchanan, neither ot*
whom is scrupulous in introducing words srom which a
modern one is deduced, in the exact sense os the Eng-
lish analogous term, although that term may have been
greatly perverted from its original meaning.

1 aare examined the “Life oi Washington, in Latin
Prose, by Francis Gloss, A. M„ os Ohio,” edited by J .
N. Reynolds, and look upon it as a work of merit, evin· ’
cing more than ordinary classical attainments in the
author. lt contains a collection oi useful historical.
facts, narrated in a very pleasing, animated style. It is
a very good specimen os modern Latinity; the languags
correct, the words oi great purity, and the peculiarity ot*

the Latin idiom being preserved with great purity through· 1 ⁴
out. It presente numerous erampies of the happy trans· ⁸

lation oi modern ideas, words, and phrases, into the

y ancient language. It might be a vaiuable addition to

the private iibrary of the student of Latin, inducing him,
by the interest of the subject and style, to a voiuntary
perusal os works in that ancient languag03 and it might

be read extempore before the*instructer with advantage,
