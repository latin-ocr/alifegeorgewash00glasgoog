The matter 01 the work ie wall selected, well arranged,
and happily proportioned in its factsand reflectione.

The narrative never flags3 it ie animated throughout;
and the observatione with which it is imerspersed natm

Father 01 their country, instead 01 those other works in
modern Latin, whiohare now eo extensively used.

cation. As regards the grammatical construction, the ”

most fastidioua reader will find little to give offence.
The incidente 01 the narration are well selected; and
considering the difficulty 01 describing modern events in
an ancient tongue, the ingenuity 01 the author in the se-
lection 01 his words, in the expressiveness 01 his phrase-
