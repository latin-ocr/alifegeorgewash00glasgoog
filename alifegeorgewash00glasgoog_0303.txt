Drria Sta-ln compliance with your requeet‚ I have

examined‘ ‘A Lise of Waehingtons in Latin Prose, by
⁵, Francis Glaesi, A. M.‚ of Ohio.¹’ My opinion of this per·
· . {aurariae ie, that in purity of style, rotundity os period,
’;,,,·· And judiciove aelection of worda, it is exceeded by none
· ·., of the modern works introductory to the study os the
Ι “ancient Romanclaaeice„ lte imperfectione are few3 ite
beauties nupreroue. Ip will be a valuable acquisition to
our classical whiile, initiatory to Caeaar or Nepos, or
such first Roman author aa the teacher may see cause to
adopt. Such an American book has hitherto been ade
sideratum.. lt ie now furnished. It ia well calculated
to fire the youthsul genius, and inspiro the genereus mind

with the pnreat patriotic sentimente.

In thus expreeaing myself‚ 1 cannot help mingling
aomo feeling with nry recollectione of the author. Iwaa
acquainted with Mr. Glase from his boyieh days. He
was an enthusiastic votary os the classic muse immedi-
ately on his initiation into the Grammar School. That
he laboured not in vain, this production will be a laeting
memorial.

Very respectfully, youre, Ata,
