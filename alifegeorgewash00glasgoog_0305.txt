D. PRENTICE.
Juy tiu, reae.

From tle Rev. Jotn Mocleon, Vice-President aad Profeess
sor of Accient [engeuger aad Literoture ofthe Goz-
lege of Nem-Jercey.

Tur Life ot* Washington, by Francis Glass, is, in the
opinion of the subscribet, awork of singular merit, and of
that degree of excellence which is claimed ferit bytho
edit013 who, by its publication, has discharged a just debt
ol' gratitudo to his able preceptor.

An uuqualified approval is not claimed for the work,
nor is it the designes the subscribet to give it such a

, . one. His engagements, during the time it has been in
his hands, have not admitted of his examining the entire
work, yet he doubts not that a perusal os the whole would
serve only to deepen the favourable impressione already
received.

The handsome manner in which the work is presented
to the public, reflecte great credit upon all concerned in
its publication.

It is to be hoped that the youth of our country may
become familiar with this production of eripe scholar}
and that they may learn to emulate the author¹s ardour in

the study of the ancient classice.
