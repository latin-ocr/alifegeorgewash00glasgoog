susurronum.

parison strikes the spectator much as is, sor a personifica-
tion of poetry‚ a fac-simile of Alexander Pope should he
set bv the side of the Apollo Belvidere. Such are my
comparisons between ancient and modern eloquence.
But then I am told that we can resort to translations sor
all the spirit os ancient composition. Ii all the young
menos our country could be taught to read and under-
stand yonr Life os Washington, and then to read a page
οἰ Livy, Sallust, or Tacitus, and afterward endure a
translation, it would be time to burn up all the classice.
I should be sorry to lose them, and therefore hope your
Life of Washington may be extensively read.
I am with much respect, alr,
Your obedient servant,

J. Q· ADAMS.

Dran Sia -1 duly received your favour of August
’ loth, together witha copy ol the Life of Washington, by
the late Mr. Glass3 for which, plesse accept my hearty
thanks.

1 fully concur in the very favourable opinion οἰ its ex,-
traordinary merits expressed by Professor Anthon of
Columbia Collega. I have, on all suitable occasions,
spoken of the work in such terms es to induce at least
a sew of my acquaintance to purchase it. Our book-
sellem, at my instance, keep a supply on hand. l have
recommended it in the newspapers as an excellent text·

book for the classioal school and academy: and l believe ι’
our toachers are about to introduce it accordingly. 1 ·

will cheerfully do all in my power to extend its circula·
tionis this part os the country.
1 heve the honour to be, dear sir,
Very respectt'ully,

Your most obedient servant,

PHILIP LlNDsLllY.
