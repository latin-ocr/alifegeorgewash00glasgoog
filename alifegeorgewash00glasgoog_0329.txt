sin-1 have just completed sn attentive and ended
petusal of the Life of Washington ιιι the Latin language,
frum the pen of Francis Glaes, edited‚ and receutly pub·
. lished by yourseli. As a literary enterprise this novel
’ productiori rs deserving of the highest commendation.
Although in some degree open. to mitialem, the manauco
ie perspicuum-the language strong and elegant, andthe
Latinity remarkably chaste. But whatever may be the
faults os style or idiom. the shalts os criticism aretutned
aeide, while we pause to do homage to the genius of the
man and the eruditiones the scholar. The author has ,
laid the foundation for a new era in modern biographicnl
history, npgn which future scholare will erect au imper-
ishable superstructum to the memories os the good and
great of our country.

And in what language can we so befittingly embalm
the actions os distinguished Americans es in the mejestic
periodo of the Roman!

. The introduction ol this modern classic iuto the
schools and universities of the United states, must be
productive oi great moral and intellectual benefit to Amer-
can youths. Early taught, through its peges, and in the
eublimest ol human languages, the principles of true
greatness‚ patriotism, and political liberty-illustrated by
the life and actions of the distinguished subject os thie

ι biography-they will transfer the veneration with which

they revere the manes of the great men of antiquity to the
august shade of the Father of their Country; and that
halo of glory with which young scholare, in all ages, have
loved to encircle the heroes of Greoce and Rome, will
heressim, with a brighter and more hallowed lustro, sur·
round the memory of Washington.
