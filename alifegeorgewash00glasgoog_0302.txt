Ar the request of Mr. Reynolds,l have examined the* ’
manuscript oi a Latin Biographyol Washington, by the
late, hlr. Glass, of Ohio, and·consider it well worthy ol .
publication. Itis, indeed, quite a curiosity os its kind.
There is generally an air of stiffness in the productione
of modern Latinists, which soon betrays a want of fa·
miliarity, on the part of the writer, with the idiom em·
ployed by him. Nothing of this nature is to be discov-
ered in the present work; on the contrary, the most cur·
sory reader cannot fail to be struck with the easy flow
os the style, and the graceful turn of very many of the peri·
ods. The care, too, which has been exercised in the se-
iection of appropriate terrns and phrases is worthy ol
notice, especially when taken in connexion with the fact
of the author's having written his work without the aid
os any books os reference. and his having been compel-
led, consequently, to rely solely on the stores of his own
memory. l would not wish to be understood as viewing
this production in the light of en accurately critical and
finished piece, but yet Ι cannot help thinking that it will
make a very good school-book. For the subJect will iu·
terest the young scholar, and awaken the best feelings iu
his bosom; while, is the Latinity of the work should at
any time appear to the instructer oi a questionabls or er·
roneous character, hs cert consult the improvement of
his pupils, and at the same time display his own acumen,

in suggesting other and better expressions.
