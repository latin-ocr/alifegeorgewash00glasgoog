now-at this very moment-with all his odditios and ap-
pertenances about him We behold the low leg cabin
01 a schoolhouse-—the clapboard 1001 but indifferently
light-the holes, ycleped windows, covered with oiled
paper to keep out the air-the benches 01 hewn timber
stuck fast in the ground-the storo, the desk, the urchins,
and the Professor. We can hear the worthy pedagogue’s
classical ‘⁴ Salver,” and our ears are still tingling with his
hyperclassical exhortatione. In nuth, he was aman after
our own beart, and, were we not Alexander, we should
have luxuriated in being Glass.

A word 01 two respecting the Latinity 01 the book.
We sincerely think that it has been underrated. While
we agree with Mr. Reynolds, for whose opinions. gen·
erally, we have a high respect, that the work can boast
01 none 01 those elegances 01 (11011011101101111001ογλ
01 those beauties and graues which adorn the pages 01
some modern herminis, we think he has forgottem in his
search aiter the mere flowers 01 Latinity, the peculiar na·
ture 01 that labour in which Mr. Glass has been employ-
ed. Simplicity ltere was the most reasonable, and indeed „
the only admissible elegance. And 11 this bo taken into
consideration, we really can call 1ο mind, at this moment,
110 medem Latin composition whatever much superior to
the Wcsbingtonii Vita ol' Mr Glass.

The clothing ot' modern ideas 111 a language dead sor
centurias, is a task whose difficulty can never be sully
appreciated by those who have never undertaken 11. The
various changes and modifications which, since 11101111-
gustan ago, hare corne to pass in the sciences 01 warand
legislation especially, must render any attempt similar to
that which wo are now criticising one 01 tho most haz-
ardous and awkward imaginable. But we cannot help

thinking that our author has succeeded ιὶ 0101001110. His
ingenuity is not less remarkable than his grammatical
skill. lndeed, he is never at a loss. lt is nonsense to
laugh at his calling Qnakers Tremebuodi. Tremebuadi is
as good Latinas Trementer, and more euphonical Latin
than 01001011-101 both which latter expressions we hare
the authority 01 8011000111 and glandes plumbeo, 101
