From the Seuthem Literary Merrenger ser Dec, 183⁵.

We may truly say that not 100 years have we taken up
a volume with which we have been so highly-gratified, as
with the one now before us. A Life of Washington,
succinet in 10000, yet in matter sufficiently comprehensive,
has been long a desideratum: but a Life 01 Washington,
precisely such 00-0000000011000 1110 01 that great man¹
should be-written bya citizen os Ohio-and written, too,
in Latin, which is not one jot 10100100οο the Latinos
Erasmus, is, to say the least 01 it, a novelty.

We consess that we regarded the first announcement
01 this rara avis with an evil and suspicious eye. The
thing was improbable, we thought. Mr. Reynolds was
quizzing us-the brothers Harper were hoaxed-and
Messieurs Anthou and Co. were mistaken. At all events,
we had made up 000 minda to be especially severe upon
Mr. Glass, and to put no saith in that species 01 classical
Latin which should emanare from the backwoods 01 01010.
We now solemnly make arecantation 01 000 000000001001 .
opinions, and οο 0000001 immediately to do penance 100
000 unbelief.

Mr. Reynolds is entitled to the thanls 01 1010 country-
nren 100 his instrumentality 10 bringing this book before
the* public. It has already done wonders in the 0000001
the classics; and we are salse 0000100ῑο 11 it do not ulti-
mately prove the means 01 stirring 00 to a new 1110 001
a regenerated energy that 1000 01 the learned tongues
which is the aurest protection 01000 own vernacular lan-
guage from impurity, but which, we are grieved to see, 10
10 0 languishing and dying condition in the land.

We have read Mr. Res 0001000 with great attention;
and meeting with it, as we have done, among a multipli-
city 01 worldly concerns and every-day matters and oo-
currences, it will long remain impressed upon 000 minda
00 00 0010010 01 the purest romanco. We have no diffi-
culty in entering sully with Mr. Reynolds into his hindly
feelings towards Mr. Glass. We 00000100 at once that
we 0001110000100010010000000001 the man. His im·
age is engraven upon our saucy. Indead, we behold him
