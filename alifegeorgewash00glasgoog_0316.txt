TESTIMONIAM·

the intervalsrof his toiisorne life, have still nourished hit
deeply·rooted love os classic lore, still brooded ovet

bright aspiratiotrs after future glory, till he could imagine, s

himself about to share in future ages the farne of the
great Washington aa his biographer and panegyrist: thet
he should actually hare found leisure to· commatice and
carry on, in such a style of elegant and classical Latinity,
